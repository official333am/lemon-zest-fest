      <p>Hey Potential Sponsor!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Lemon Zest is an upcoming festival in the DMV area bringing together fine artists, music acts, and folks in the
        community. When the world shut down this past year, we wanted a way to give back to the community that made us
        the artists that we are today. The name Lemon Zest Festival comes from the phrase “when life gives you lemons,
        you make lemonade.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Lemon Zest is a music and arts festival for all ages. We hope to bring together young budding and seasoned
        artists together to experience each other’s art and tunes. We also hope to highlight community organizations and
        businesses whose work we admire and align with our values of joy, community, and eclecticism.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Lemon Zest team is made up of local artists and musicians who know and are in love with the music and art
        scene within the DMV area. We have both performed and hosted events in the region, so we understand the
        importance of planning an event by and for artists and musicians.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We are also partnering with Alex’s Lemonade Stand for this festival. Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) is
        changing the lives of children with cancer by funding impactful research, raising awareness, supporting families
        and empowering everyone to help cure childhood cancer. Also, Alex’s Lemonade Stand is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
        organization! A percentage of your donations made to Lemon Zest Fest will benefit Alex’s Lemonade Stand and be
        <span class="font-weight-bold">tax deductible.</span>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>We also have the option in our sponsorship tiers to directly sponsor an artist or performer. We understand that
        all labor, especially creative labor, is valuable and want to fairly compensate our artists and performers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We’d love for you to review the various tiers of sponsorship below. Please let us know if you are interested in
        becoming an official Lemon Zest Fest sponsor!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thanks,
        <br>

      <p>One of our values as a festival is community and we believe our artists make up a large part of that community. Separate from our sponsorship package, we are giving our sponsors the opportunity to sponsor an artist (exhibition or musical) so that we can show our appreciation for the artists who bring their vision and sound to the DMV area. We have options for sponsoring musicians based on performance length or based on the number of pieces they exhibit. Inquire more today!</p>
