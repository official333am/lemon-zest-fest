      <h1>Welcome, First-Time Zesters!</h1>
      <p>
        Lemon Zest is a festival in the DMV area bringing together fine artists, music acts, and folks in the community.
        When the world shut down this past year, we wanted a way to give back to the community that made us the artists
        that we are today. The name Lemon Zest Festival comes from the phrase “when life gives you lemons, you make
        lemonade.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lemon Zest is a music and arts festival for all ages. We hope to bring together young budding and seasoned
        artists together to experience each other’s art and tunes. We also hope to highlight community organizations and
        businesses whose work we admire and align with our values of joy, community, and eclecticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mask and vaccination policies will be addressed as we get closer to Summer 2022 following Montgomery County, MD
        guidelines.
